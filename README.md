# **Network Traffic Analysis of an Azure Virtual Machine using Wireshark**

In this project, I will create a Windows Virtual Machine and connect to it using RDP from a Mac device. I will then use Wireshark to observe the network traffic bewteen the VM and Mac Device. Finally, I will configure the NSG (Firewall) of the Azure VM to disable/enable specific inbound and outbound protocols.

## **Technology Used:**

- Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine
- Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)
- Wireshark
- Powershell

## **Walk-through:**
